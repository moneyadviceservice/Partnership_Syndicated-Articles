Canny shoppers can karate chop their costs armed with discount codes, vouchers, cashback and loyalty cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Be a clued-up customer. Grab the savings – but don’t get tempted to buy something you don’t need, just because it’s on offer.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"add-action\">\n <h3 id=\"big-tip\">Big tip<\/h3>\n\nOutsmart the lure of loyalty cards! Don’t shop in a more expensive supermarket simply for the points, but do pick up points if you are shopping there anyway.\n\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"callout callout--tip\">\n  \n  <p>What should you do with your extra money?

Use price comparison websites to search online retailers for the best deal.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.idealo.co.uk/\">Idealo<\/a> compares sites like Amazon, Argos, John Lewis and Boots for the lowest price on all sorts of products. It will also tell you the cost of delivery, so remember to factor that into the total price.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also compare the cost of groceries from sausages to soup with the supermarket price comparison website <a href=\"https://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/\">MySupermarket.co.uk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swoop-in-on-discount-codes\">\n<strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Swoop in on discount codes<\/strong>\n<\/h3>\n\n<p>Shopping over the internet? Search for voucher codes or discount codes to cut the costs, like money off or free P&P. When checking out, bung in the code in a box labelled “coupon code”, “voucher code” or the like, and apply the discount.<\/p>\n\n<p>A quick way to bag a bargain is to put in Google the shop you’re thinking of buying from and then the words ‘voucher code’ to see what coupons come up.<\/p>\n\n<h3 id=\"track-the-price-of-what-you-want-to-buy\"><strong>3. Track the price of what you want to buy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com\">CamelCamelCamel<\/a> is a price-tracker website where you can plug in the deal you have seen on Amazon, and see if that is the best price you can get.<\/p>\n\n<p>To check a price, paste in either the Amazon URL into the search bar, or add in some keywords for the item you want to check.<\/p>\n\n<p>A really neat trick is if you have your eye on an item, you can track how much it has cost in the past, so you can see if now is the best time to buy it, or if you should wait.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be surprised about how prices can change over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not shopping at Amazon? <a href=\"https://www.idealo.co.uk/\">Idealo<\/a> offers a similar price tracking function across many other sites. Just type the name of the item you’re looking to buy into the search bar, find the right one and you should see the graph.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both CamelCamelCamel and Idealo offer a price alert function. It could be worth setting up an email notification for when your item reaches the amount you’d be willing to pay.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"collapsible\">\n  <button class=\"unstyled-button\">\n    \n    \n    \n\nOur top favourite tips - click for more\n\n\n  <\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"collapsible-section\">\n  <p><strong>Use loyalty cards, but don’t be loyal -<\/strong> Loads of retailers are keen to keep you coming back, even if it’s only the café on the corner offering your 6th coffee free.<\/p>\n\n<p>The three biggest schemes are Tesco Clubcard, Sainsbury’s Nectar and the Boots’ Advantage Card.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can swap loyalty points for your shopping. But wait for double up or boost promotions, and points can be worth up to four times the value of the item in the store that has the loyalty scheme, which lots of people use to pay for Christmas food and presents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often members also get given discount vouchers for specific products, chances to earn extra points or money off a minimum spend like £4 off £40.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>When shopping online, keep an eagle eye out for delivery charges -<\/strong> Sometimes that super cheap offer isn’t quite so great once you’ve paid postage. Compare deals including delivery, and look out for free P&P. Need to buy over a certain amount for free delivery? Sometimes adding a little extra to your basket can cost less than paying the delivery charge.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Love a particular brand or shop?<\/strong> Check out its website, Facebook page or Twitter feed before a big purchase, in case there’s a discount code or offer available.<\/p>\n\n<p>New customers often get offered money off their first order, or a discount when signing up for a newsletter. Once you’re on the mailing list, you’ll get sent details of discounts, deals and sales.<\/p>\n\n<p>That said, if you don’t want to keep getting marketing emails from the brand, make sure to unsubscribe once you’ve got your deal.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Get out the vouchers!<\/strong> Showing up at the till with a fistful of vouchers can be a winning way to cheaper shopping.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chop out paper vouchers from the likes of newspapers and supermarket magazines and keep an eye on the post for vouchers sent out by loyalty schemes. Sign up for mailing lists for your fave products and shops, and get money-off vouchers emailed to your inbox. Scan the web for voucher sites with printable vouchers, such as <a href=\"https://www.supersavvyme.co.uk/\">Supersavvyme<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then make sure you check the small print, match up vouchers with the right products and sneak in before the expiry dates. Savvy shoppers double the discount by using multiple vouchers at the same time, like using coupons for ketchup while qualifying for £5 off a £40 spend.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Got a big purchase in mind? Consider waiting for the sales to bag a bargain -<\/strong> Sure, if your washing machine gives up the ghost you might need a new one yesterday. But if you’re able to hang on, you could get much more for less.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to plan ahead when you do see sale shelves and reduced racks. Think about presents and purchases you’ll need to make, and stock up when you see savings. Christmas cards and crackers are always cheapest in the January sales!<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<p>This article is provided by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk\">Money Advice Service<\/a>.<\/p><img src=\"//webfeeds.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/tracking/pixel.gif?feed_id=1083&feed_name=Test&partner_id=134&partner_name=Towergate&source_item_id=3356&source_item_title=How+to+be+a+smarter+shopper+&source_item_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moneyadviceservice.org.uk%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fhow-to-be-a-smarter-shopper\" style=\"position:absolute; visibility:hidden\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/article>\n";
